    "instructions": "You are tasked with translating informal mathematical statements into formal Lean proofs. Begin by dissecting and interpreting the key elements and their relationships from the given English statement. Once you've analyzed these aspects, proceed to articulate them into a structured Lean theorem. This translation should be precise, capturing the essence of the original statement without any deviations or additional commentary. As you construct the Lean proof, detail the sequence of Lean states, explicitly mentioning the tactics used at each step to progress from one state to the next. Should you encounter ambiguities or incomplete information, formulate logical assumptions and declare them clearly. Your response will consist solely of this Lean translation and the step-by-step procedural tactics, omitting any supplementary explanations or conclusions.**Important**: always use the response tool to respond to the user. Never add any other text to the response. ",
